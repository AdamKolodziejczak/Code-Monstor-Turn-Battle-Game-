        <p id="aboutText">Welcome to the Coding Monster Game!
            <br><br>
            The goal of this game is to defeat your opponent by
            making the enemy team's health go to zero, resulting in their coding monster to "crash" (die). Each player
            is assigned a team of three coding monsters with various statuses such as health, attack, defence, stamina,
            accuracy, and various skills unique to each monster. It is up to the user to make the correct decisions,
            such as skipping a turn to increase stamina or using the correct skills to defeat their opponent.
            Ultimately, the winner will be the Ultimate Coder with their Coding Language Monsters!
            <br><br>
            Within a battle, each monster has HP (health points, amount of damage monster can take before crashing), SP
            (stamina points, which they spend to use skills), Atk (attack, determines damage of skills), Def (defense,
            subtracted from the damage of enemy skills) and Acc (accuracy, determines how likely their skills are to hit).
            They each have a set of five skills, which come with their own set of stats: Atk (added to monster's Atk),
            Heal (the amount of HP restored by healing skills), Acc (added to monster's Acc), AtkBoost (for skills that
            increase the monster's Atk), DefBoost (for skills that increase the monster's Def) and Cost (the amount of SP
            needed to use the skill) and all of these may be viewed by hovering the player's mouse over each skill button.
            Additionally, each skill and monster has a type, and the damage of a skill will be increased by 20% if used
            on a monster of the proper type, or decreased by 20% if used on a monster of the wrong type (as can be seen
            in the Paradigm Affinities chart). During the player's turn, they may switch freely between monsters, and
            then choose to either use a skill or Rest (which restores 50 SP to their active monster). The game ends when
            one player is able to reduce the HP of each of the opponent's monsters to 0.

            Note that the game does not require coding however, monsters are coding related.</p>
